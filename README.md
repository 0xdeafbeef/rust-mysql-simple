rust-mysql-simple
=================
Mysql client library implemented in rust. Feel free to open a new issues and pull requests.

### Documentation
It have no documentation at the moment, but will have after some api stabilization.
You may look at tests in conn.rs for usage examples. Also you can build library reference with ```make doc```.

### Performance
By now *rust-mysql-simple* is a bit faster then *Go-MySQL-Driver* on my machine.
